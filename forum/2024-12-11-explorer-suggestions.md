# Some Suggestions for the Explorer Functionalities

### **List alternative mgwiki git repos in the explorer**

**Anon1** (2024-12-11, 12:00 PM UTC):
We could list alternative (both github and non-github) mgwiki clones/repos at some section of the PG explorer. Users could also ask to have them registered, e.g. by PG alerts.


### **Add option to submit transactions**

The explorer could allow people to submit their transactions, i.e., without having to run the client.
