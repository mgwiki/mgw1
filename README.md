# Welcome to mgwiki!

This is a wiki for formal mathematics written in the Megalodon system ([1],[2]).

Megalodon is an interactive theorem prover/proof checker based on higher-order Tarski-Grothendieck set theory. It is the successor system to Egal ([3]).

The wiki allows you to edit Megalodon files online and check them automatically without the need of local installation.

The workflow is to clone/fork this repo, edit/add some files, and then commit/push, which will trigger the checking and html-ization. If there are errors, they will be shown in the output of the github action (at an address like this: https://github.com/mgwiki/mgw_test/actions/ )
and the html-ization will not be triggered. 

When your edits are done, you can issue a pull request (PR) to the main mgwiki repo.

## Conjectures, Bounties and Proofgold

The wiki can be used to create and solve open conjectures and put them
into the Proofgold blockchain with bounties ([4],[5]).

See also the list of all available bounties at the explorer ( https://formalweb3.uibk.ac.at/pgbce/bounties.php ) and also the list of recent open and collected bounties (https://formalweb3.uibk.ac.at/pgbce/recentbounties.php ) .

## Proofgold

Proofgold ([5],[4], is a blockchain for formal math. It allows
decentralized solving of open conjectures, putting bounties on them,
etc. There are several clients (Lava, Lite, Core - [6],[7],[8],[9]), the recommended one
is Proofgold Lava ([6],[7]).
